# Endgame Conditions http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/specification.php
#
# The following conditions will cause the game to end:
#
# - The turn limit is reached. The winner is the player with the most ships,
#   both on planets and in fleets. If both# players have the same number of
#   ships, it's a draw.
#
# - One player runs out of ships and planets entirely. The winner is the other
#   player.
#
# - Both players run out of ships and planets at the same time. The game is a
#   draw.
#
# - A bot sends invalid data and forfeits the game.
#
# - A bot crashes and forfeits the game.
#
# - A bot exceeds the time limit without completing its orders (it never sends
#   a line that says 'go') it forfeits the game.
#
# - A bot attempts to do something that the tournament manager deems a
#   security issue and is disqualified.
